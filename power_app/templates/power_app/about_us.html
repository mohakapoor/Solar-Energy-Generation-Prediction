        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi! I am Mohak Kapoor, and I am a BTECH Student pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering. I have a passion for Machine Learning & Open Source Development and my goal is to become a Machine Learning Engineering and Quant down the line.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I have a background in Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning and Python . Over the years, I have worked on many projects involving Python Automation, Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in Machine Learning in Algorithmic Trading.</p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> I have extensive experience in Python, utilizing it for tasks ranging from data analysis and machine learning to backend web development. I apply Python in various projects such as developing machine learning models, automating workflows, and building data-driven applications. Python's simplicity and versatility make it an essential tool in my toolkit.</li>

            <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> I have a solid understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. I apply these skills to solve real-world problems, such as predicting solar energy generation and analyzing large datasets. By using frameworks like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, I build and deploy predictive models that provide valuable insights and solutions.</li>
            
            <li><strong>C++:</strong> I am proficient in C++ and use it for performance-critical applications, such as system-level programming and developing complex algorithms. I leverage C++ in projects that require high efficiency and real-time processing, including machine learning model optimization and simulation of large-scale systems. C++ allows me to handle low-level memory management and fine-tune performance to meet specific project requirements.</li>
            
    
        </ul>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>Over the years, I have worked on several projects. Some of my key experiences include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Project/Experience 1:</strong> Nifty50 Trend Prediction<br>
                ◦ Developed a stock market prediction model focusing on Nifty50 trends using historical data from Yahoo Finance.<br>
                ◦ Employed Random Forest Classifier machine learning algorithm to predict short-term market trends.<br>
                ◦ Tools: Python, Sklearn, Pandas, NumPy, yfinance
            </li>
            <li><strong>Project/Experience 2:</strong> Solar Power Generation Predictor<br>
                ◦ Developed a machine learning model that predicts solar power generation based on historical data and environmental conditions.<br>
                ◦ Integrated weather data from the Accuweather API, geographical information, and time-based features for accurate predictions.<br>
